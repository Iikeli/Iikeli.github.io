#  Build Publish Sites With Xcode Plugins

On [the last article](https://www.iiroalhonen.com/posts/publish-tutorial/) I published, I explained how to build and release a website made with Publish using GitHub Actions. On this tutorial I will refactor some of that code, so the building is done on the developer machine as the project is build by using [Swift Package Plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110359/).
