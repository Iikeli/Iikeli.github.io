I'm focusing on the "organization" style page, since I am creating my own personal website. If you want to follow along in code, I am using a git branch for this that you can find <a href="https://github.com/Iikeli/Iikeli.github.io/tree/publish-tutorial">here</a>.</p><h2>GitHub Pages</h2><p><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> is a service that GitHub provides for publishing a website for you, a company, or a project. For free you get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites. It's a perfect way to host basic websites as a developer and it's why I'm moving my websites from Webflow to GitHub Pages to save on costs.</p><h3>Setting up your GitHub Pages website</h3><p>The setup for GitHub Pages is really simple: just follow the step-by-step instructions on <a href="https://pages.github.com">the front page</a>.</p><ol><li>Create a repository with the name <code>*ORG_NAME*.github.io</code>. Note that the <em>ORG</em>NAME* needs to match the username/organization name exactly, otherwise it won't work.</li><li>Clone the repository created <code>$ git clone https://github.com/*ORG_NAME*/*ORG_NAME*.github.io</code></li><li>Navigate to the folder <code>$ cd *ORG_NAME*.github.io</code></li><li>Create an <code>index.html</code> file with <code>$ echo "Hello World" &gt; index.html</code></li><li>Push the new file to the git repo <code>$ git add .</code> -&gt; <code>$ git commit -m "Initial commit"</code> -&gt; <code>git push</code></li></ol><p>That's it for the setup. The new site will be running at <code>https://*ORG_NAME*.github.io</code> when the automatically provided GitHub action finishes running.</p><h2>Publish</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> is a static site generator build for Swift developers by John Sundell. It enables websites to be build using Swift, supports themes, plugins, etc. The Publish framework is used to create John Sundells site <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com">swiftbysundell</a>.</p><h3>Setup</h3><p>Publish comes with a command line setup tool and you can install it using Homebrew by running <code>$ brew install publish</code>. <em>Note: the homebrew support is not officially maintained.</em></p><p>For us to be able to setup our website using publish, we need to empty the directory for our website before being able to run <code>$ publish new</code> to create all the files we need. I simply moved the index.html to the desktop, ran <code>$ publish new</code>, and copied it back and deleted it in another commit. This way it's easier to follow all the smaller steps using the <a href="https://github.com/Iikeli/Iikeli.github.io/tree/publish-tutorial">git branch</a>.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Developing a Publish website is fairly simple if you are familiar with Swift Packages and have Publish installed locally (like you do if you have followed this tutorial).</p><p>Running the site on your local machine is as easy as using the command line and running <code>$ publish run</code>. This will build the site and create a locally running server at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. Navigate there to see the locally running template site.</p><p><strong>More information coming here</strong></p><h2>Deploying the site</h2><p>If you were to push this to your git repo now, it will not run. That is because your output files (being your actual HTML files) are located in the <code>Output</code> folder while GitHub looks for the <code>index.html</code> file in the root of the project. This will give you lovely <code>404 File not found</code> error for your site. The interesting thing is that from the settings for your repo, under <code>Settings -&gt; Code and automation -&gt; Pages</code> there is an option for setting the branch to be build and a folder to build, but it will only give you two options: <code>/(root)</code> and <code>/docs</code>.</p><p>This is obviously a problem, but it is easily solvable by writing a custom GitHub action.</p><h3>Custom GitHub Action for deployment</h3><p>To use a custom GitHub Action for development go to <code>Settings -&gt; Code and automation -&gt; Pages</code> and under <code>Build and deployment</code> select <code>GitHub Actions</code> for the <code>Source</code>.</p><img src="https://www.iiroalhonen.com/custom-github-actions-setup.png" alt="Enable custom GitHub Actions"/><p>Then we customize the template to look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions: write-all

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Copies and installs Publish by John Sundell
      - name: Checkout Publish
        run: brew install publish

** # NOTE: THIS DOES NOT COMMIT THE NEWLY CREATED CHANGES **
      - name: Build Publish site
        run: publish generate

      - name: Push Output folder to a git subtree for automatic deployment
	    run: git push origin `git subtree split --prefix Output main`:production --force
</code></pre><p>Save the workflow and give it a descriptive name, like <code>deploy.yml</code>. Now it will run on all pushes to main.</p><p>The neat part about this workflow is that we are using <code>git subtree</code> command to push the Output folder to essentially its own branch that we can deploy using the automated system. Go back to <code>Settings -&gt; Code and automation -&gt; Pages</code> and under <code>Build and deployment</code> select <code>Deploy from a branch</code> for the <code>Source</code>. For the branch you need to select <code>production</code> which doesn't exist yet. You can either let merge the changes to you <code>main</code> branch or run <code>git subtree push --prefix Output origin production</code> command manually. After that the branch is created and you can set it as the build branch.</p><p>There are two parts that are not ideal about this workflow that you should be aware of: 1. Using <code>Homebrew</code> to install <code>Publish</code> for it's build tooling, you could avoid this by running the <code>publish generate</code> command on your machine to limit the amount of work for the GitHub Actions machines, but including it does enforce that the code you are committing is the code being hosted. 2. Using force push to ignore conflict that might rise when pushing the <code>Output</code> folder to the <code>production</code> branch.</p><p>That's it. Now you have a website that is build with <code>Publish</code> running on <code>GitHub Pages</code>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
